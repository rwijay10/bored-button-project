    <p class="p1">You know what? I'm so bored. I'm extremely bored. Nothing else will make me excited. This is the most bored i have been in ages, I wonder what would happen if I clicked this button. Would it take me to a place of no boredom? I think I'm gonna click this button. I mean what could possibly happen?</p>
